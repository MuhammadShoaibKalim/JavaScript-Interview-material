         <children/>
      </UserContext.Provider>
    );

      {children}
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default UserContextProvider;

=====================================================

import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import UserContext from '../context/UserContextApi';

const Profile = () => {
  const { user } = useContext(UserContext);

  if (!user) {
    return <div>Please login to continue.</div>;

  );
};

export default Login;

==============================================================================================
import React from "react";

const userContext =React.createElement();
export default userContext;

==============================================================================================
```
1. **Difference between == and ===**
   - `==` is used for value equality, while `===` is used for both value and type equality.
   - `==` performs type coercion, converting the types of operands to match, while `===` requires both operands to have the same type without coercion.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     console.log(1 == '1'); // true
     console.log(1 === '1'); // false
     ```

2. **Primitive and non-primitive data types**
   - **Primitive data types**: These are immutable data types and include string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.
   - **Non-primitive data types**: Also known as reference types, these include objects and arrays. They are mutable and stored by reference.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let primitive = 'Hello';
     let nonPrimitive = [1, 2, 3];
     ```

3. **Use of ‘this’ keyword**
   - `this` refers to the object it belongs to.
   - Its value is determined by how a function is called.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const obj = {
       name: 'John',
       greet: function() {
         console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
       }
     };
     obj.greet(); // Hello, John
     ```

4. **Difference between Regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions**
   - Regular functions:
     - Have their own `this` binding.
     - Cannot be used as constructors with `new`.
   - Arrow functions:
     - Lexically bind `this` to the surrounding execution context.
     - Cannot be bound with `new` or used as constructors.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const regularFunc = function() {
       console.log(this);
     };

     const arrowFunc = () => {
       console.log(this);
     };

     regularFunc(); // Logs the global object
     arrowFunc(); // Logs the lexical `this`
     ```

5. **Closures**
   - A closure is a function that retains access to variables from its lexical scope even after the scope has exited.
   - It allows functions to maintain access to variables from outer scopes in which they were defined.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     function outerFunction() {
       let outerVar = 'I am outer';

       function innerFunction() {
         console.log(outerVar);
       }

       return innerFunction;
     }

     const closureFunc = outerFunction();
     closureFunc(); // Logs 'I am outer'
     ```

6. **Hoisting**
   - Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
   - This allows variables to be used before they are declared.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     console.log(x); // undefined
     var x = 5;
     ```

7. **Promises**
   - Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
   - They provide a cleaner alternative to callback-based asynchronous code.
   - Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       setTimeout(() => {
         resolve('Promise resolved');
       }, 2000);
     });

     promise.then((result) => {
       console.log(result); // Logs 'Promise resolved' after 2 seconds
     });
     ```

8. **Difference between let, var, and const**
   - `var`: Function-scoped variable declaration, hoisted to the top of its function or global scope.
   - `let`: Block-scoped variable declaration, not hoisted, can be reassigned.
   - `const`: Block-scoped variable declaration, not hoisted, cannot be reassigned (but its properties can be modified for objects and arrays).
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     var a = 10;
     let b = 20;
     const c = 30;

     function example() {
       console.log(a, b, c);
     }

     example(); // Logs 10 20 30
     ```

9. **Destructuring**
   - Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
   - It offers a concise way to extract multiple values from data stored in objects and arrays.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
     const { name, age } = person;
     console.log(name, age); // Logs 'John 30'
     ```

10. **Prototype Chain**
    - The prototype chain is a mechanism in JavaScript where objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype object.
    - It allows objects to delegate behavior to their prototype, enabling inheritance in JavaScript.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      function Animal(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }

      Animal.prototype.sayName = function() {
        console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
      };

      const dog = new Animal('Buddy');
      dog.sayName(); // Logs 'My name is Buddy'
      ```

11. **Asynchronous**
    - Asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking the main thread.
    - It is essential for handling time-consuming operations like network requests, file I/O, and user input/output.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Async operation');
      }, 2000);
      ```

12. **New features in ES6**
    - ES6 introduced several new features such as arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, default parameters, rest parameters, spread syntax, classes, and more.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const greeting = (name) => {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
      };

      console.log(greeting('World')); // Logs 'Hello, World!'
      ```

13. **Event bubbling and capturing**
    - Event bubbling is a phenomenon in which an event triggered on a nested element propagates up through its ancestors.
    - Event capturing is the opposite, where the event starts from the outermost element and propagates downwards to the target element.
    - **Example:**
      ```html
      <div id="outer">
        <div id="inner">Click me!</div>
      </div>
      ```
      ```javascript
      document.getElementById('outer').addEventListener('click', () => {
        console.log('Outer div clicked');
      }, true);

      document.getElementById('inner').addEventListener('click', () => {
        console.log('Inner div clicked');
      }, true);
      ```

14. **Null vs Undefined**
    - `null` represents the intentional absence of any value and is a primitive value.
    - `undefined` indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value, or a property does not exist.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      let x;
      console.log(x); // Logs undefined

      const y = null;
      console.log(y); // Logs null
      ```

15. **Function expression vs function declaration**
    - Function declaration: Function declarations are hoisted and can be invoked before they're declared in the code.
    - Function expression: Function expressions are not hoisted and cannot be invoked before their declaration.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      functionDeclaration(); // Logs 'Function declaration'

      const functionExpression = function() {
        console.log('Function expression');
      };

      functionDeclaration(); // Logs 'Function declaration'
      ```
16. **Call, apply, bind**
    - `call()` and `apply()`: These methods are used to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and arguments.
    - `bind()`: This method creates a new function with a specified `this` value and, optionally, a set of initial arguments.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const person = {
        name: 'John',
        greet: function(message) {
          console.log(message + ', ' + this.name);
        }
      };

      const newPerson = { name: 'Alice' };

      person.greet.call(newPerson, 'Hello'); // Logs 'Hello, Alice'
      ```

17. **ES6 arrow function vs normal function**
    - Arrow functions are more concise and lexically bind `this` to the surrounding context.
    - Normal functions have their own `this` context and can be used as constructors with `new`.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
      console.log(multiply(2, 3)); // Logs 6

      function Product(name, price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
      }

      const apple = new Product('Apple', 1);
      console.log(apple); // Logs { name: 'Apple', price: 1 }
     ```

     # ES6 Features and JavaScript Concepts
     
18. **ES6 Features**
- Let and const keywords.
- Arrow functions.
- Multi-line Strings.
- The destructuring assignment.
- Enhanced object literals.
- Promises.

19. **Difference between var, const, and let**
- Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped; Variables declared with var are globally-scoped or function-scoped.
- var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
- var can be hoisted to the top of their scope. Where var variables are initialised as undefined, let and const variables are not initialised(Temporary Dead Zone, TDZ).
- While var and let can be declared without being initialised, const must be initialised during declaration.

 20. **Promises and Async-Await**
- Promises enable asynchronous programming in JavaScript, allowing a program to call a function with the expectation that it will return a result for further computation.
- Async-await is syntactic sugar for promises, simplifying asynchronous programming and preventing callback hell.

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { 
    // promise condition
});
```

 21. **How does JavaScript maintain concurrency?**
- Event Loop.
- Micro & Macro Queue.
- Callback.
- Thread Pool & Clustering (Multi-Threading).

22. **What is a callback and how does it work behind the scene?**
- The callback is possible only because JavaScript supports the first-class function.
- A function that has passed as an argument to another function or it can be executed in that other function is called a callback.
- In Node.js, it consists of 4 default threads that are responsible for maintaining the main stack and other queues, most asynchronous functions call other asynchronous functions and then call the callback. You can think of it as a chain of functions and callbacks. All asynchronous and IO operations are directly not handled by the main thread, All callbacks and asynchronous calls have been handled by the other queue which presents in the JS engine.

23. **How many ways do we have for declaring a function and how are they different from each other?**
- A function declaration has made of a function keyword, followed by an obligatory function name, a list of parameters in a pair of parenthesis.
- Shorthand method definition can be possible to use in a method declaration on object literals and ES2015 classes.
- An Arrow function is defined using a pair of parenthesis that contains the list of parameters. Followed by a fat arrow => and a pair of curly braces that delimits the body statements.
- In a function expression, you assign a function to a variable.
- A function can be dynamically created using the Function constructor, but it suffers from security and performance issues and is not advisable to use.

24. **Output of Code**

```javascript
x = 5;
var x;
(function fun() { 
    {
        let x = 1;
        x++;
        console.log(x);
    }
    console.log(x);
})();
```
25.  **What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?**
    
     Java and JavaScript are unrelated programming languages. Java is an object-based, strongly typed language. It's used in app development and runs on a virtual machine.
     It's also known for block scoping and thread- based concurrency, which consumes more memory. In contrast, JavaScript is an object-oriented, dynamically typed language.
     JavaScript is used for web applications in browsers and Node.js environments. It utilizes function-scoping event-based concurrency and is more memory-efficient. This
      makes it ideal for web pages. The key differences lie in typing, scoping, concurrency models, and memory usage.
     
      
27. **What is is JSON in JavaScript**
    
      Javascript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format in web applications. Its function is to represent structured data using JavaScript object syntax.
      It transmits data between a server and a client, enabling seamless data display on web pages. JSON is a text file with a .json extension and an 'application/json'
      MIME type, making it ideal for network data transfer.In practice, JSON operates through two key processes: parsing and stringification. Parsing involves converting
      a string into a native object using JSON.parse(text). Stringification is the reverse. It transforms a native object into a string with JSON.stringify(object) for
      network transmission. This dual functionality makes 
      JSON a versatile tool in web development.
    
    
29.   **Explain how cookies work in JavaScript?**
    
       Cookies in JavaScript function as a way to store user information (like usernames) between web sessions. When a server sends data to a visitor's browser, the data may
       include a cookie. If the browser accepts this okie, it's saved as a plain text file on the visitor's hard drive. Upon later visits to the same site, the browser returns
       this cookie to the server. This process lows the server to retrieve the stored formation to enable a seamless user experience.

30. **What is the primary goal of React Fiber, and how does it aim to achieve it?**

      The primary goal of React Fiber is to increase React's suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures by enabling incremental rendering. This means splitting rendering work into chunks spread out over 
       multiple frames. Additionally, Fiber aims to introduce features such as pausing, aborting, or reusing work as new updates come in, assigning priority to different types of updates, and implementing newconcurrency 
      primitives.

 31 **What is reconciliation in React, and why is it essential?**

 Reconciliation is the algorithm used by React to diff one tree with another, determining which parts need to be changed. It's crucial because it allows React to update the user interface efficiently by computing only the necessary changes instead of re-rendering the entire application on every update.

32. **How does React separate reconciliation from rendering, and why is this separation important?**

React separates reconciliation, which computes which parts of the tree have changed, from rendering, which updates the rendered application. This separation allows React to support various rendering environments, such as the DOM and React Native while using the same reconciler. It also enables optimizations and flexibility in scheduling updates, contributing to a smoother user experience.

33. **What is scheduling in React, and why does React use a pull-based approach?**

Scheduling in React refers to the process of determining when work should be performed, and prioritizing different types of updates. React utilizes a pull-based approach where computations can be delayed until necessary, allowing the framework to make smart decisions about when to execute work based on factors like user interactions and frame rates. This approach avoids unnecessary work and optimizes performance by deferring updates until they are needed.

 34. **What is a fiber in React Fiber's architecture, and why is it essential?**

Answer: In React Fiber, a fiber represents a unit of work, allowing React to break rendering work into incremental units for better control over scheduling and performance. Fibers enable React to pause, resume, prioritize, and reuse work, contributing to features like incremental rendering and concurrency. They serve as virtual stack frames, allowing React to optimize rendering for user interfaces effectively.    


35. **What are the common JavaScript data types?**
    
When answering this question, give an example for each data type if possible.
Example: Common JavaScript data types are boolean, number, object, string and undefined. These can be divided into three categories of primitive, composite and special.


36. **How do a confirmation box and alert box vary?**
    
JS interviewers ask this question to know how effectively could you create code that simplifies the message for the user.
Example: Both these boxes are used to communicate a message to the user. While the alert box has only one option to click on (OK), the confirmation box has two (OK and CANCEL).


37. **Name the three pop-up boxes that exist in JS**
    
This question indicates your ability to create interactive and followable interfaces for users.
Example: The three pop-up boxes in JS include Alert, Confirm, and Prompt.


38. **What are two ways to read and write a file using JS?**
    
This JS interview question helps analyze your basic usability metric with the programming language.
Example: A file can be read or written on JS through either a webpage and Active X objects, or JS extensions.


39. **What exactly are global variables?**
    
This tests the candidate's insights on reducing the usage of local variables and saving up on memory.
Example: If the var keyword, which is used to declare a locale object or variable, is omitted, then a global variable is declared. Additionally, 
global variables exist all across the code to eliminate any limitations.


40. **What does negative infinity mean in JS?**

    
Despite being more of a value-related answer, negative infinity also helps in looping.
Example: When any negative number is divided by zero, you get a JS number called negative infinity. Also, when divided by itself, it returns NaN.


41. **What is the NaN property in JavaScript?**

    
NaN stands for “not a number” and can help identify whether a value is a valid number or not. For example, finding the square root of a negative number returns NaN.
Example: NaN represents non-number values. Simply put, it helps identify invalid numbers.


42. **Name the three looping structures in JS**

    
Loops are a highly utilized feature in any programming language and indicate the coder's ability to cut down longer codes into shorter ones.
Example: For, While and Do-while are the three looping structures.


43. **What would be the output of 5+9+”2” in JS?**

    
This question tests your idea of how numeric calculations occur in JS programming.
Example: As 2 is placed within a string, it would be concatenated to the sum of 5+9. Thus, the output is 142.

44. **What is DOM in JavaScript?**

    
DOM helps in managing web documents through code. Using DOM in JS, the coder gets access to the components of a webpage.
Example: Document Object Model is automatically created by the web browser once the page has loaded. Each and every element of the webpage can be accessed, and modified from the DOM.


45. **What are the window.onload and onDocumentReady features?**
Both these functions are related to the loading of the webpage and code. Explain your answers in terms of which feature manipulates the code quicker.
Example: While onDocumentReady downloads the code right before the DOM is ready, it permits the coder to manipulate the code early. Whereas, window.onload does not begin till all webpage information isn't ready. Moreover, it causes delays before the code is run.


47. **What are the 3 types of errors in JavaScript?**

    
These errors are automatically generated and categorised into three types. If you can portray your code-resolving abilities with a diversified knowledge of how these errors arise then you would be able to create a good impression.
Example: The three error types in JS are Load-time, Runtime and Logic errors. Any of these errors would interrupt the smooth functioning of the program.

48. **Name the two basic groups of data types in JS**
    
This explains your flexibility when it comes to using a large variety and number of variables.
Example: The two basic groups of data types in JS are Primitive and Reference types. Primitive types represent only number and Boolean types, whereas reference types consist of more complex data types such as strings and dates.

49. **Explain the event delegation model in JavaScript.**
Event delegation is a technique involving adding a single event listener to a parent element that catches all events of a specific type from its child elements.
This is useful for handling dynamically added elements or reducing the number of event listeners.

```document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function(e) {
  if (e.target && e.target.nodeName === "LI") {
    console.log("List item clicked!");
  }
});
```

50. **How do you implement inheritance in JavaScript?**

Inheritance in JavaScript can be implemented using prototype chaining, where an object inherits properties and methods from another object.
Example:

```function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(this.name + ' makes a noise.');
}

function Dog(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name);
}
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak(); // Rex makes a noise.
```

#### 1. What is the output of the below code

```javascript
var car = new Vehicle("Honda", "white", "2010", "UK");
console.log(car);

function Vehicle(model, color, year, country) {
  this.model = model;
  this.color = color;
  this.year = year;
  this.country = country;
}
```

- 1: Undefined
- 2: ReferenceError
- 3: null
- 4: {model: "Honda", color: "white", year: "2010", country: "UK"}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### 2. What is the output of below code

```javascript

```

- 2: ReferenceError: X is not defined
- 3: 1, undefined and number
- 4: 1, number and number

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Of course the return value of `foo()` is 1 due to the increment operator. But the statement `let x = y = 0` declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,

```javascript
let x;
window.y = 0;
x = window.y;
```

Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable `y` is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The statements order is based on the event loop mechanism. The order of statements follows the below order,

1. At first, the main function is pushed to the stack.
2. Then the browser pushes the first statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately.
3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.
4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.
5. The callback of `setTimeout` moved from Browser API to message queue.
6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute
7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.
8. The `console.log` for B is added to the stack and display on the console.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The main points in the above code snippets are,

1. You can see function expression instead function declaration inside if statement. So it always returns true.
2. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too.

In other words, it is same as

```javascript
var y = 1;
if ("foo") {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

**Note:** It returns 1object for MS Edge browser

##### Answer: 3

This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.

Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.

```javascript
function foo() {
  return {
    message: "Hello World",
  };
}
console.log(foo()); // {message: "Hello World"}
```

- 4: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The `delete` operator will delete the object property but it will not reindex the array or change its length. So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed.
If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use `empty` instead of `undefined` to make the difference a bit clearer.

##### Answer: 2

In non-strict mode, the regular JavaScript functions allow duplicate named parameters. The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.
The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.

```

- 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
- 2: 3
- 3: undefined
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Arrow functions do not have an `arguments, super, this, or new.target` bindings. So any reference to `arguments` variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.

Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the function

```javascript
const func = function () {
  return arguments.length;
};
console.log(func(1, 2, 3));
```

But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected arguments

```javascript
const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

In order to be consistent with functions like `String.prototype.padStart`, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as `trimStart`. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'

The `indexOf` uses strict equality operator(===) internally and `NaN === NaN` evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.
But you can use `Array.prototype.findIndex` method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use `Array.prototype.includes` to check if NaN is present in an array or not.

##### Answer: 4

The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.

But you control the array sequence using for..of loop,

```javascript
async function processArray(array) {
  for (const item of array) {
    await delayedLog(item);
  }
  console.log("Process completed!");
}
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 3

Symbol follows below conventions,

1. Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string.
2. `Symbol.for()` function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.

**Note:** The symbol description is just useful for debugging purposes.

- 3: It is not a string!, It is a number!
- 4: It is a string!, It is a number!

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The return value of `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString` is always a truthy value (either "number" or "string"). The ! operator operates on either `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString`, converting them to boolean values. Since the value of both `!typeof myNumber` and `!typeof myString` is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.

To make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:

```
if (!(typeof myNumber === "string"))
```

Or simply use the inequality operator:

```
if (typeof myNumber !== "string")
```

##### Answer: 2

The symbols has below constraints,

1. The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.
2. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}).

##### Answer: 2

If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error `Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` as mentioned above.

You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,

1. **Pass at least an empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area({});
```

2. **Assign default empty object:**

```javascript

  console.log(length * width);
}

If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument is the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a parameter.

Hence, the result of function calls categorized as below,

1. The first two function calls logs number type since the type of default value is number
2. The type of '' and null values are string and object type respectively.

11 and 10 is logged to the console.

The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable `count` which overwrites the ourter `count` variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.
Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.

##### Answer: 3

Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its **.then/catch/finally** handlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current program, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before the log of promise handler.

But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.

```javascript
console
  .log("First line")
  [("a", "b", "c")].forEach((element) => console.log(element));
```

Hence, there will be **cannot read properties of undefined** error while applying the array square bracket on log function.

```javascript
var of = ["of"];
for (var of of of) {

- 2: SyntaxError: Unexpected token of
- 3: SyntaxError: Identifier 'of' has already been declared

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

In JavaScript, `of` is not considered as a reserved keyword. So the variable declaration with `of` is accepted and prints the array value `of` using for..of loop.

But if you use reserved keyword such as `in` then there will be a syntax error saying `SyntaxError: Unexpected token in`,

```javascript
var in = ['in'];
for(var in in in) {
  console.log(in[in]);
}
```

- 4: Cannot sort numbers

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

By default, the sort method sorts elements alphabetically. This is because elemented converted to strings and strings compared in UTF-16 code units order. Hence, you will see the above numbers not sorted as expected. In order to sort numerically just supply a comparator function which handles numeric sorts.

```javascript
const numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(numbers);
```

**Note:** Sort() method changes the original array.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

When the JavaScript engine parses the above code, the first two statements are asynchronous which will be executed later and third statement is synchronous statement which will be moved to callstack, executed and prints the number 3 in the console. Next, Promise is native in ES6 and it will be moved to Job queue which has high priority than callback queue in the execution order. At last, since setTimeout is part of WebAPI the callback function moved to callback queue and executed. Hence, you will see number 2 printed first followed by 1.

IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is just like any other function expression which won't be hoisted. Hence, there will be a reference error for message call.
The behavior would be the same with below function expression of message1,

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Due to hositing feature, the variables declared with `var` will have `undefined` value in the creation phase so the outer variable `currentCity` will get same `undefined` value. But after few lines of code JavaScript engine found a new function call(`changeCurrentCity()`) to update the current city with `var` re-declaration. Since each function call will create a new execution context, the same variable will have `undefined` value before the declaration and new value(`Singapore`) after the declarion. Hence, the value `undefined` print first followed by new value `Singapore` in the execution phase.

The function call `functionOne` is not going to be part of scope chain and it has it's own execution context with the enclosed variable environment. i.e, It won't be accessed from global context. Hence, there will be an error while invoking the function as `functionOne is not defined`.

- 3: {name: "John", eat: f}, undefined
- 4: {name: "John", eat: f}, Window {...}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

`this` keyword is dynamic scoped but not lexically scoped . In other words, it doesn't matter where `this` has been written but how it has been invoked really matter. In the above code snippet, the `user` object invokes `eat` function so `this` keyword refers to `user` object but `eatFruit` has been invoked by `eat` function and `this` will have default `Window` object.

The above pit fall fixed by three ways,

1. In ES6, the arrow function will make `this` keyword as lexically scoped. Since the surrounding object of `this` object is `user` object, the `eatFruit` function will contain `user` object for `this` object.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var eatFruit = () => {
      console.log(this);
    };
    eatFruit();
  },
};
user.eat();
```

The next two solutions have been used before ES6 introduced.

2.  It is possible create a reference of `this` into a separate variable and use that new variable inplace of `this` keyword inside `eatFruit` function. This is a common practice in jQuery and AngularJS before ES6 introduced.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var self = this;
    var eatFruit = () => {
      console.log(self);
    };
    eatFruit();
  },
};
user.eat();
```

3. The `eatFruit` function can bind explicitly with `this` keyword where it refers `Window` object.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var eatFruit = function () {
      console.log(this);
    };
    return eatFruit.bind(this);
  },
};
user.eat()();
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

In JavaScript, primitives are immutable i.e. there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created. So when you try to update the string's first character, there is no change in the string value and prints the same initial value `Hello World!`. Whereas in the later example, the concatenated value is re-assigned to the same variable which will result into creation of new memory block with the reference pointing to `John Smith` value and the old memory block value(`John`) will be garbage collected.

In JavaScript, the variables such as objects, arrays and functions comes under pass by reference. When you try to compare two objects with same content, it is going to compare memory address or reference of those variables. These variables always create separate memory blocks hence the comparison is always going to return false value.

##### Answer: 3

The variable `message` is still treated as closure(since it has been used in inner function) eventhough it has been declared after setTimeout function. The function with in setTimeout function will be sent to WebAPI and the variable declaration executed with in 5 seconds with the assigned value. Hence, the text declared for the variable will be displayed.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 1

Eventhough both variables `a` and `b` refer a number value, the first declaration is based on constructor function and the type of the variable is going to be `object` type. Whereas the second declaration is primitive assignment with a number and the type is `number` type. Hence, the equality operator `===` will output `false` value.

##### Answer: 2

Eventhough the above function returns the same result for the same arguments(input) that are passed in the function, the `console.log()` statement causes a function to have side effects because it affects the state of an external code. i.e, the `console` object's state and depends on it to perform the job.

The above promises settled at the same time but one of them resolved and other one rejected. When you use `.all` method on these promises, the result will be short circuted by throwing an error due to rejection in second promise. But If you use `.allSettled` method then result of both the promises will be returned irrespective of resolved or rejected promise status without throwing any error.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

If you put `setTimeout` and `setInterval` methods inside the try clause and an exception is thrown, the catch clause will not catch any of them. This is because the try...catch statement works synchronously, and the function in the above code is executed asynchronously after a certain period of time. Hence, you will see runtime exception without catching the error. To resolve this issue, you have to put the try...catch block inside the function as below,

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  try {
    console.log("try block");
    throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error: ", err);
  }
}, 1000);
```

You can use `.catch()` function in promises to avoid these issues with asynchronous code.

- 3: Reference Error: printHello is not defined, Good day
- 4: Hello, Reference Error: printMessage is not defined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The function `printHello` is hoisted to the top of the global scope and prints "Hello" to the console. Even `printMessage` function is hoisted, but it is lifted to the local scope(in "printHello") it was declared in. That is the reason you will endup with reference error for second function call.

But if the second function is invoked in the first function itself, there won't be any reference error.

```javascript
printHello();

function printHello() {
  printMessage();
  console.log('Hello')

  function printMessage() {
    console.log("Good day")
  }
}

##### Answer: 1

Even though there is a timer of 5 seconds supplied to `setTimeout` callback, it won't get executed until the main thread is free and finished executing the remaining part of the code. In this example, the remaining code(while loop) takes 10seconds to finish it's execution. In the mean time, the callback will be stored in callback queue upon completion of its 5 seconds timer. After 10 seconds, the callback will be moved to callstack because the callstack is empty by poping out global execution context.
